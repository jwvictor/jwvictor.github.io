It's the year 2023, and just like the partners at DCG predicted\*, Bitcoin has dominated the world.

Since the Vancouver Accord in 2022, when the world's leaders voted to abolish fiat currencies, Bitcoin has been the main way to remit value. Most people have their private key embedded in a device in their skin; the old folks use their phones, for fear of the surgery.

I've been in my apartment since Monday. The landlord is a bit pedantic, and he's angry my rent payment hasn't gotten included in a block yet. I got paid late, and I'm short funds, so I can't put up a giant bounty to get it put through immediately. I need to use three different accounts, so that's three different trasactions, and lately, transactions with no extra bounty have been taking up to a day or two. I told him it's the law that he can't hold it against me, but I'm always worried he's going to change the locks on me and have me out on the street. After all, that's money he needs to pay his bills, so I do understand.

But I'm hungry, so I'm going to the corner to get a burger. I look at my phone for my account balance: just fine. So I quietly leave the apartment, lock the door behind me, and creep past the landlord's office.

When I get to the burger spot, I hit a snag. The price of a burger in BTC -- reflected on a digital display above the counter -- had increased to ten times the normal amount since I'd left home. It would darn near zero out my account, but I'm hungry. So I go up to the counter.

"What happened with the price?" I asked the cashier.

"It's the AgriCoin price. All these burgers been costing us a fortune," he answered.

I was aware that AgriCoin was the predominant currency in agricultural circles, but was annoyed it had changed in value. _This happens all the time_, I thought to myself. Harvest time causes congestion in the AgriCoin chain, which in turn causes food prices to spike. Economists say it has something to do with the difficulty schedule of AgriCoin, or some such. Whatever it is, it's annoying.

"One double burger with grilled onions and an extra grilled bun," I say, trying to forget that I was paying a price equivalent to roughly $100 back in the fiat days.

"That'll be 33.251924... something," the cashier answered, pointing at the point-of-sale screen in front of me.

I scanned my skin implant to sign the transaction request, and my payment was submitted to the blockchain. After a few minutes, I notice my order on the counter, so I ask the cashier if I can start eating.

"I'm sorry, sir, that order hasn't had enough confirmations yet," he said. "And store policy is to use default transaction costs."

_Default!_ I thought. Everyone knows the saying, "default is death." It could take hours for my payment to clear. When the Bitcoin network gets busy, the _default_ transaction costs won't clear until pretty much everything more important has.

"Fine," I said, starting to get grumpy. "Can you keep it warm for me? I'll come back in an hour or so."

"Of course, sir, thank you for understanding," he answered.

I arrived back at the burger shop an hour later to an unexpected new price: my 33 BTC burger was now 2.5 BTC.

"What the hell happened with the price?" I asked the cashier.

"Oh, Amazon dedicated a spare data center to AgriCoin so food is back at a normal price now," he answered, laughing. "It's a good thing, too, 'cause I thought I'd be waiting until tomorrow to eat again."

I took my $100 burger and left in silence.


 
\* Meant in jest. I'm sure DCG is a great firm.

## Overview 

The Byteboard Foundation was founded by [Jason Victor](https://jwvictor.github.io) to support the development of [Byteboard](https://www.byteboard.org), an anonymous blogging platform that uses cryptographic proofs of content ownership to allow authors to claim their work after-the-fact. The hope is to support the efforts of people who want to speak out in a way that may be socially unpopular or stigmatized -- even illegal -- in their jurisdiction without having to sacrifice their <em>droit d'artiste</em> and all that comes with it.

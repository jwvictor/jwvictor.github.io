My name is Jason Victor, and I'm an entrepreneur and engineer living in south Florida, USA, and I build awesome stuff.

I am currently the founder of [Memberry.ai](https://memberry.ai), an AI app seeking to help users remember things and stay organized with minimal effort. Previously, I was founder and CEO of [Routefire](https://routefire.io/), which was acquired by Coinbase in 2021. I'm also working on a number of other [Projects](https://jwvictor.github.io/projects.html), from apps to teach children about fine arts to a blob storage CLI and a DSL for LLM interactions. I'm interested in machine learning/AI, cryptography and cryptocurrencies, engineering, mathematics, economics, and entrepreneurship.
